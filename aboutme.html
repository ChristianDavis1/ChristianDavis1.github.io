        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Christian Davis, I am a Junior at Palm Desert High School, and I hope to major in computer technology later in life. I am not sure what profession I will go into specifically involving computer technology, but I am interested in game development and seems it would fit me as a person. To achieve going into working at a job that I enjoy for the rest of my life, I focus on standing out in high school so I can get into a nice college and set me up for success.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have experience in basic computer science already. For all of my middle school years (6-8th grade) at Palm Desert Charter Middle School, I participated and competed in their advanced robotics program. In the class, we worked in small teams to score as many points as we could on a custom board using a robot we design and code. The competition is called botball.         </p>
        <br>
        <p>In High School this year I am taking 3 AP courses to try and stand out to colleges. I enjoy challenging myself because it sounds good on paper. In school, I am the president of my highschoolâ€™s SpikeBall Club. We occasionally play in tournaments and strive to win. Last summer I worked at Desert Builders Inc. as a construction worker. I have learned how to be given instruction and execute on the requests given through working there.
        </p>
         <br>
        <p>My experiences and goals over the years say much about who I am trying and will be in the future. I hope to one day be able to call myself successful and so far, to date, I consider that as a fact.
